# WWP - Wizard's Waterfall Process

Please use the [Workbook](./Workbook.docx) in order to follow this process.

This is a simple waterfall development process. It is broadly aligned with 
Units 4 and 9 of the
[BTEC Level 3 in ICT from Pearson Education](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-nationals/information-technology-2016.html).

The process consists of 6 phases, with sub-steps aligned to units 4 and 9, 
which allows these two units to be studied at the same time (as they often are).

```
1. DEFINE

9B1 Ideate (what could we build?)
9B2 Feasibility (how might we build it? Select from options)
9B3 Specification (what will it do?)

2. PLAN

9C1 Project Plan (what steps will we follow?)
9C2 Execute Plan (monitor and control)
4B1 Development Plan (what development steps will we follow?)

3. DESIGN

4B2 Design (how will it work?)
4C2 Test (the design)
4C3 Optimise (the design)

4. CREATE

4C1 Develop (the code)
4C2 Test (the code, as you go along)
4C3 Optimise (the code, as you go along)

5. VERIFY

4C2 Test (the product, formally)
4C4 Document (the test results)

6. EVALUATE

4C4 Review (design and code)
4C5 Behaviours (methods used throughout development)
9D1 Post Mortem (of entire project)
